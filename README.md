##🌐 Currency Converter — Async/Await Version
- A simple, clean, and fully functional currency converter app built using vanilla JavaScript with async/await, fetch(), and real-time exchange rate data via the ExchangeRate API.

- This is a refactored version of my previous .then()-based build — rebuilt for clarity, structure, and modern JS practices.

##  🔧 Features
- 🔁 Live currency conversion using exchange rate API
- 🗃️ Dropdown injection of all currencies using Object.keys()
- 💻 Built with async/await + full try/catch error handling
- 📉 Swap button to flip currencies with auto recalculation
- 🧠 Live input-based rendering without requiring button click
- 📎 Error messages for invalid input, empty fields, or API failure
- ⚡ Loading state shown during fetch calls

🧱 Fully modular and clean logic, beginner-friendly flow
